![Chat Alerts Banner](./.github/README/banner.png)

Chat Alerts gives small streamers a chance to engage with their chat without sabotaging their stream content. Gone are
the days of constantly looking at the chat window to see if there are new messages or not, let Chat Alerts take care of
that. Focus on what's really important.
